<h2>Futura</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)" target="_blank" title="html15
  specification">Futura</a></strong> is a geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927.
  [1] It was designed as a contribution on the New Frankfurt-project. It is based on geometric shapes, especially the circle, similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.[2][3]
  It was developed as a typeface by the Bauer Type Foundry, in competition with Ludwig & Mayer's seminal Erbar typeface of 1926.[4][5]
